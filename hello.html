        <b>Greeting</b> is an act of communication in which <i> <b> human beings </b> </i> intentionally make their
        presence known to each other, to show attention to,
        and to suggest a type&nbsp;of&nbsp;relationship (usually cordial) or social status (formal or informal) between
        individuals or groups of people
        coming in contact with each other.

        <center>
            <h3 style="font-size:90px">Greetings</h3>
        </center> Greetings are sometimes used just prior to a conversation or to greet in passing, such as on a
        sidewalk or trail.
        While greeting customs are highly culture- and situation - specific and may change within a culture depending on
        social status and relationship, they exist in all known human cultures.<br />
        Greetings can be expressed both audibly and physically, and often involve a combination of the two.
